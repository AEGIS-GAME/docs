description: Check whether the survivor is alive
---

```py
def is_alive() -> bool
```

## Description

This check is only relevant when the `SURV_HEALTH_DECAY_RATE` configuration is greater than zero,
meaning survivors can die over time.

## Returns

A boolean indicating whether the survivor is alive.

## Example

```py
loc = get_location()
top_layer = get_cell_info_at(loc).top_layer

if isinstance(top_layer, Survivor):
  if top_layer.is_alive():
    # Do something with alive survivor
  else:
    # Do something with dead survivor
```
