description: Calculate the squared Euclidean distance from this location to another

<Callout type="error" title="Heuristic">
  DO NOT use this for your A-Star heuristic.
  This returns the squared Euclidean distance, which may overestimate the actual cost.
</Callout>

```py
def distance_to(location: Location) -> int
```

## Parameters

<DocEntry 
  entries={[
    {
      name: "location",
      description: "The target location."
    }
  ]} 
/>

## Returns

The squared distance between the two locations.

## Example

```py
loc1 = Location(0, 4)
loc2 = Location(1, 3)

distance = loc1.distance_to(loc2)
log(f"distance: {distance}")
```
