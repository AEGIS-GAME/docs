```py
def get_cell_info_at(loc: Location) -> CellInfo
```

## Description

If the location is adjacent (1 tile away) to the agent or has been scanned by a drone,
all layers and agents at that location are visible. Otherwise, only the top layer is
visible and agent presence is hidden.

If `HIDDEN_MOVE_COSTS` feature is enabled, unvisited cells have `move_cost = 1`.

## Parameters

<DocEntry 
  entries={[
    {
      name: "loc",
      description: "The location to query."
    }
  ]} 
/>

## Returns

A CellInfo object following visibility rules.

## Example

```py
loc = get_location()
adj_loc = current_loc.add(Direction.NORTH)

cell_info = get_cell_info_at(adj_loc)

log(f"Cell Info: {cell_info}")
```
