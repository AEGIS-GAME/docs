description: Recharge the agent's energy if on a charging cell

```py
def recharge() -> None
```

## Description

Each call restores `Constants.NORMAL_CHARGE` energy, without exceeding
`Constants.MAX_ENERGY_LEVEL`.

If the agent is not on a charging cell, this function has no effect.

## Example

```py
loc = get_location()
charging_cells = get_charging_cells()

if charging_cells and loc in charging_cells:
  recharge()
```
