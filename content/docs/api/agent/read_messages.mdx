title: read_messages 
description: Retrieve messages from the agent's message buffer 
---

```py
def read_messages(round_num: int = -1) -> list[Message]
```

## Description

If no `round_num` is provided, messages are returned in reverse-chronological order --
from the most recent round to the oldest -- up to the buffer size defined by
`Constants.MESSAGE_HISTORY_LIMIT`.

This buffer stores only the most recent `Constants.MESSAGE_HISTORY_LIMIT` rounds. Once full,
older messages are overwritten by new ones.

## Parameters

<DocEntry 
  entries={[
    {
      name: "round_num",
      description: "If provided, only messages from the specified round are returned."
    },
  ]} 
/>

## Returns

A list of messages.

## Examples

```py
# Read recent messages (from newest to oldest)
messages = read_messages()

for msg in messages:
  log(f"[Round {msg.round_num}] From Agent {msg.sender_id}: {msg.message}")
```

```py
# Try to read messages from a specific round
old_round = get_round_num() - 2
old_messages = read_messages(old_round)

if not old_messages:
  log(f"No messages available from round {old_round} (possibly overwritten).")
else:
  for msg in old_messages:
    log(f"[Round {old_round}] From Agent {msg.sender_id}: {msg.message}")
```
