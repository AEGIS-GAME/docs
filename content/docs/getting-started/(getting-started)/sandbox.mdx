title: Sandbox Environment
description: The restricted Python environment.
---

By default, all agents run inside a [restricted Python](https://restrictedpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) sandbox.  
This means many of Pythonâ€™s standard features are disabled.

Attempting to use anything not listed below will cause your agent to crash.

### Printing

`print()` is disabled in the sandbox. Use the `log()` function instead to output messages.

### Imports

Only the following imports are allowed:

```py
self.allowed_modules: set[str] = {
    "os",
    "typing",
    "pathlib",
    "random",
    "heapq",
    "math",
    "json",
    "re",
    "enum",
    "numpy",
    "tensorflow",
    "tf",
}
```

And the default `aegis.stub`.

If you think that any additional packages should be included, please create an [issue](https://github.com/AEGIS-GAME/aegis/issues)
on the GitHub.

### Restricted Names in Agent Files

Any function, variable, or class in your agent file that starts with `_` will cause your agent to crash.
Avoid defining any names that begin with an underscore.

This restriction is in place to prevent agents from accessing internal Aegis functionality.

```py
# Safe
def pathfind() -> None:
  ...

# Unsafe. Will crash the agent.
def _pathfind() -> None:
  ...
```
