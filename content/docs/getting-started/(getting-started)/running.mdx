Aegis can be run in two ways: via the command-line interface (CLI) or the graphical client.
Choose the method that best fits your workflow. CLI is ideal for quick testing and automation,
while the client provides a more visual experience.

## Command Line Usage

To run Aegis from the terminal, use the aegis command:

```
aegis launch [-h] --world WORLD [WORLD ...]
  [--amount AMOUNT] [--rounds ROUNDS] [--agent AGENT]
  [--agent2 AGENT2] [--client] [--debug] [--log]
```

### Example

Here's an example of running Aegis with a "test" agent, `ExampleWorld.world` and 50 rounds:

```
aegis launch --world ExampleWorld \
  --rounds 50 --agent test 
```

### Example with Logging

To save console output to a log file:

```
aegis launch --world ExampleWorld \
  --rounds 50 --agent test \
  --log
```

### Full Command Options

```
options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --world WORLD [WORLD ...]
                        One or more world names (without .world extension), separated by spaces.
  --amount AMOUNT       Number of agents to run (default = 1)
  --rounds ROUNDS       Number of simulation rounds (default = 1000)
  --agent AGENT         Name of the agent folder under 'agents/' with a main.py file for team Goobs (e.g.,
                        'agent_path', 'agent_mas')
  --agent2 AGENT2       Name of the agent folder under 'agents/' with a main.py file for team Voidseers (e.g.,
                        'agent_path', 'agent_mas')
  --client              Used by the client, tells the server to wait for the client to connect
  --debug               Enable agent debug logging output
  --log                 Enable AEGIS console output logging to a file
```

## Client Usage

You can open the client either through the terminal or your system's file explorer.

<Tab value="Mac">

To open the client from the terminal:

```bash
cd client
open Aegis.app
```

Or simply double-click `Aegis.app` from Finder.

If you see the following error, follow the [mac error guide](../../../errors/mac/security).

</Tab>

<Tab value="Windows">

To launch the client from the terminal:

```bash
cd client
.\aegis-client.exe
```

Or double-click `aegis-client.exe` in File Explorer.

</Tab>

<Tab value="Linux">

To launch the client from the terminal:

```bash
cd client
./aegis-client.AppImage
```

Alternatively, you can launch the AppImage from your preferred file manager by double-clicking it.

Once the client opens, follow the steps below to run a simulation.

<Steps>

### Set the Aegis Path

Since the client cannot automatically locate your project files, click the **Setup Aegis Path** button and
select the root `aegis` directory. This root directory contains your worlds, agents, and client folders.

If the setup is successful, the sidebar tabs will appear and you'll be able to select worlds and agents in
the **Aegis** tab.

  If you accidentally select the wrong path, you can reconfigure it anytime from the
  **Settings** tab.
</Callout>

### Configure Simulation Options

Navigate to the **Aegis** tab and fill in the required options before starting up a simulation.

### Start the Simulation

Once all required fields are set, the **Start Up Game** button will become active.
Click it to launch the simulation. You'll know it's running when the console logs confirm startup
or the button changes to **Kill Game**.

### Confirm

If everything is configured correctly, the simulation will start and display in the main window.

</Steps>

## Logging Types

Aegis supports two distinct types of logging.

### Debug

By default, all `log()` calls in your agent file are disabled.
To see the log output, run your command with the `--debug` flag.

In the client, you can also enable or disable debug logging through the settings.

### Log

Use the `--log` flag to save game output to a file with timestamps.
This makes it easier to review or search through past runs.

Logging only works in the console. Log files are saves in the `logs/` folder.
