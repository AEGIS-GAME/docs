PowerShell may block certain scripts from running by default.
This can prevent tools like virtual environments from working properly in your code editor.
The steps below show how to adjust your execution policy so these scripts can run safely.

<Steps>

### Open PowerShell as administrator

Press `Win + X` and select Windows PowerShell (Admin) or search for PowerShell,
right-click, and choose Run as Administrator.

### Set the Execution Policy

Run the following command in the PowerShell window:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

### Confirm the Change

Hit Enter. When prompted, type `A` to allow all scripts and press Enter again to confirm the change.

### Reopen Your Code Editor

Close and reopen your code editor (VS Code, for example). After doing this, you should now be able
to activate the virtual environment without any issues.

</Steps>
