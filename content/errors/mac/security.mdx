Sometimes, when you try to open an app that isnâ€™t signed by an identified developer,
MacOS will prevent it from launching and show a warning. If you trust the app, you can
manually allow it to run by adjusting your security settings.
The steps below show how to do this.

<Steps>

### Open System Settings

Navigate to the Apple menu and click on "System Settings" (or "System Preferences" on older MacOS versions).

### Locate Security Settings

Select "Privacy & Security" from the sidebar. Scroll down to the "Security" section.

### Allow Aegis to Run

Look for the message "Aegis was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer" (or something similar) and click "Open Anyway" next to it.

### Confirm Your Choice

In the popup that appears, click "Open" to confirm you want to run Aegis.

</Steps>
