If you see the error `Cannot import 'Override' from 'typing'`, it usually means
your Python version is not compatible with that feature. The steps below show
how to check your Python version and recreate your virtual environment to resolve
this issue.

<Steps>

### Ensure You Are Using Python 3.13

Confirm that your virtual environment is using `Python 3.13` by running the following command with
the environment activated:

```bash
python --version
```

If the version shown is not `3.13.x` check your system python installations for the correct version.
If not installed, follow the [Python Guide](../../../guides/python/).

### Recreate the virtual environment

To ensure that your environment is properly set up, recreate your virtual environment.
Make sure you run the command in the `aegis` directory.

```bash tab="Mac/Linux"
python3 -m venv .venv

or

python3.13 -m venv .venv
```

```bash tab="Windows"
python -m venv .venv

or

py -3.13 -m venv .venv
```

```bash tab="uv"
uv venv --python 3.13 .venv
```

</Steps>
